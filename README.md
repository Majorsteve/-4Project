### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Add Auth for Users
- Users can create read and delete new Topics
- Users can create read delete and update comments
- Rails Backend
- React Frontend

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Users can sub-comment on any comments
- Adding a categories list
-Add Upvoting on comments

## React Component Hierarchy

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

## Functional Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Login Page | This will render the login page | 
| Register Page | This will render the Register page | 
| Home Page | This will render the all the topics created from every user | 
| Create Topic | This will render a form where users can create a topic | 
| Create Comment | This will render a form where users can create a comment | 
| Comment Page | This will render all comments | 


<!-- Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string of text | 

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
